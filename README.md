# Caesar Cipher Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Features

- Encrypts a message by shifting letters by a specified number.
- Decrypts a message using the reverse shift.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
- Includes input validation for user prompts.
